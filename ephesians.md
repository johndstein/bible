# Ephesians

## Chapter One

This letter is from Paul. God made me an official emisary of
his chosen king Jesus.

To those in Ephesus who are set apart and faithful to Jesus
God's chosen king.

We pray that God our father and Jesus God's chosen king will
give you grace and peace.

I praise the God and father of our Lord Jesus God's chosen
king. He has blessed us in the heavens with every spiritual
blessing through Jesus his chosen king.

God chose us to be united with Jesus before the creation of
the world and to be holy and blameless in his eyes.
In love he destined us to be his adopted children through 
Jesus his chosen king. It was his pleasure and decision to
do this, and we praise his amazing grace, which he has so
freely given us through our union with the one he loves.

Jesus purchased us with his blood so our evil deeds are 
forgiven. This was done by the amazing riches of God's 
grace which he has lavished on us with incredible wisdom and
understanding.

God has revealed to us the mystery -- the awesome plan that he was
pleased to carry out through his chosen king. The plan was to 
wait until just the right time and then to
bring everything in heaven and earth together under one ruler, 
his chosen king.
